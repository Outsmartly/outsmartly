# Quick Start (Next.js)

## Install

```shell
npm install --save-dev @outsmartly/next-plugin-outsmartly
npx outsmartly init
# Follow the prompts
```

1. Begin by installing Next.js.

   `yarn create next-app`

2. Install Outsmartly.

   `yarn add --dev @outsmartly/next-plugin-outsmartly`

3. Open `package.json` in the root directory. In the scripts object add `OUTSMARTLY_DEV=true` as a value of `dev`, and type `"outsmartly:deploy": "outsmartly deploy production"` in `scripts`.

   ```json
   {
     "name": "example",
     "version": "0.1.0",
     "private": true,
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "OUTSMARTLY_DEV=true next dev",
       "build": "next build && if [ \"$VERCEL_ENV\" == 'production' ]; then outsmartly deploy production; fi",
       "start": "next start",
       "outsmartly:deploy": "outsmartly deploy production"
     },
     "dependencies": {
       "next": "9",
       "react": "16",
       "react-dom": "16"
     },
     "devDependencies": {
       "@outsmartly/next-plugin-outsmartly": "^0.0.20"
     }
   }
   ```

   When you deploy to production on Vercel, you are also deploying your override.

## Part B: Setting up Next.js and Outsmartly Config File

1. Create a Next.js config file in the root of your directory.

   `touch next.config.js`

2. Put `@outsmartly/next-plugin-outsmartly` into the plugin array in your newly created `next.config.js` file. The key is `name` and the value is `@outsmartly/next-plugin-outsmartly`.

   ```javascript
   module.exports = (phase, { defaultConfig }) => {
     return {
       experimental: {
         plugins: true,
       },
       plugins: [
         {
           name: '@outsmartly/next-plugin-outsmartly',
         },
       ],
     };
   };
   ```

3. Stay at the root of your project and create a new Outsmartly config file.

   `touch outsmartly.config.js`

4. Enter the following into your Outsmartly config file.

   ```javascript
   export default {
     host: 'example.outsmartly.app',
     environments: [
       {
         name: 'production',
         origin: '',
       },
     ],
     routes: [],
   };
   ```

   `host:` Put your Outsmartly assigned domain here. Don't have one? Get on [Outsmartly's Developer Waitlist](https://www.outsmartly.com/signup)!

   `name:` Env where you are deploying your app. Most common values are `production` and `staging`.

   `origin:` Where the edge will make requests to. Also where your html is stored. For example, `https://landing.vercel.app`.

## Part C: Creating Your First Override

1. From the root of your project cd into the `pages/` directory and create `_document.js`.

   a. Write a Outsmartly tag before `<NextScript />`.

   ```javascript
   import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';
   import { OutsmartlyScript } from '@outsmartly/react';
   export default class CustomDocument extends Document {
     render() {
       return (
         <Html>
           <Head />
           <body>
             <Main />
             <OutsmartlyScript />
             <NextScript />
           </body>
         </Html>
       );
     }
   }
   ```

2. Enter the following code to the index file.

   a. Add the `// @outsmartly` comment before the `Home` function
   b. On the bottom of the file write a server-side function and return the prop with the headline value of `Welcome Humans`.

   ```jsx
   import { useState } from 'react';
   import Head from 'next/head';
   import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css';

   // @outsmartly
   export default function Home({ headline }) {
     return (
       <div className={styles.container}>
         <Head>
           <title>Create Next App</title>
           <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
         </Head>
         <main className={styles.main}>
           <h1 className={styles.title}>{headline}</h1>
           <p className={styles.description}>
             Get started by editing <code className={styles.code}>pages/index.js</code>
           </p>
           <div className={styles.grid}>
             <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs" className={styles.card}>
               <h3>Documentation &rarr;</h3>
               <p>Find in-depth information about Next.js features and API.</p>

               <h3>Learn &rarr;</h3>
               <p>Learn about Next.js in an interactive course with quizzes!</p>
             </a>

               href="https://vercel.com/import?filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_medium=default-template&utm_campaign=create-next-app"
               className={styles.card}
             >
               <h3>Deploy &rarr;</h3>
               <p>Instantly deploy your Next.js site to a public URL with Vercel.</p>
             </a>
           </div>
         </main>
         <footer className={styles.footer}>
           <a
             href="https://vercel.com?utm_source=create-next-app&utm_medium=default-template&utm_campaign=create-next-app"
             target="_blank"
             rel="noopener noreferrer"
           >
             Powered by <img src="/vercel.svg" alt="Vercel Logo" className={styles.logo} />
           </a>
         </footer>
       </div>
     );
   }
   export async function getServerSideProps() {
     return {
       props: {
         headline: 'Welcome humans!',
       },
     };
   }
   ```

3. Go into your Outsmartly config located at the root of your directory and create your personalization. In this example, you are going to change the headline prop value from `Welcome Humans!` to `I have made another change. ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤–`.

   ```javascript
   export default {
     host: 'example.outsmartly.app',
     environments: [
       {
         name: 'production',
         origin: '',
       },
     ],
     routes: [
       {
         path: '/',
         overrides: [
           {
             name: 'Landing Page Title',
             component: 'Home',
             propOverrides: ['headline'],
             async compute() {
               return {
                 props: {
                   headline: 'I have made another change. ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤–',
                 },
               };
             },
           },
         ],
       },
     ],
   };
   ```

   `path:` Route handler. For example, `/user/:id`.

   `name:` Human-readable label of the override.

   `component:` Contains the prop that will be overridden at the edge.

   `propOverrides:` A list of property paths that you will override in the compute function.

   `compute:` An asynchronous function that executes the logic onto your override.

## Part D: Deploying App with Production Origin

1.  [Get on Outsmartly's waiting list](https://www.outsmartly.com/signup), and you will be provided with `host` url. In this example the `host` url is example.outsmartly.app.

2.  [Sign up for Vercel](https://vercel.com/#get-started).

3.  Create your [app to Vercel](https://vercel.com/#get-started). When you are in the process of deploying your app on Vercel, be sure to enter your Outsmartly token into the Vercel platform.
    `name: OUTSMARTLY_TOKEN value: ******-****-****-*****-*****`

    Go Settings/Environmental Variables from Vercel's homepage

    Step A.

    !['Enter your Outsmartly token here'](https://res.cloudinary.com/blockchain-side-hustle/image/upload/v1607886268/env-variables_vxpemr.png)

    Step B.

    !['Be sure to choose secret'](https://res.cloudinary.com/blockchain-side-hustle/image/upload/v1609187629/Screen_Shot_2020-12-28_at_9.16.16_PM_kbdd7b.png)

        Step C.

        ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmghm3eu4/image/upload/v1609884431/Outsmartly/Screen_Shot_2021-01-05_at_11.06.38_PM_gqiusq.png)

        Be sure to check the "Automatically expose System Environment Variables" box so that Outsmartly will be able to deploy your production app onto the edge.

4.  Take the url propagated by Vercel, open `outsmartly.config.js` and enter the url as the value of `origin`. In this example, the url is `https://outsmartly-override-example.vercel.app/`. Outsmartly edge servers goes in front of the origin and executes your overrides.

    ```javascript
    export default {
      host: 'example.outsmartly.app',
      environments: [
        {
          name: 'production',
          origin: 'https://outsmartly-override-example.vercel.app',
        },
      ],
      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',
          overrides: [
            {
              name: 'Landing Page Title',
              component: 'Home',
              propOverrides: ['headline'],
              async compute() {
                return {
                  props: {
                    headline: 'I have made another change. ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤¯',
                  },
                };
              },
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    };
    ```

5.  After you have entered the origin url `https://outsmartly-override-example.vercel.app` into your Outsmartly config file. Commit and push your changes to Github, which will set a webhook that will build and deploy your app.

Congratulations. Check out your override on `example.outsmartly.app`!

## Bonus: Make Your First Override Locally

1. Go to the root of your `Next.js` project and run the development server.

   `yarn dev`

2. [Install cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/quickstart) on your machine. Then open a new terminal and navigate to the root of your Next.js project. Enter the following into the command line:

   `cloudflared tunnel http://localhost:3000`

3. Start the cloudflared tunnel. Take the url in the output and put it in `origin` found in your Outsmartly config file. Note that the url will change every time you restart the tunnel.

   ```javascript
   origin: `https://outsmartly-override-example.vercel.app`;
   ```

4. Open the third terminal and deploy the override onto Outsmartly's edge server.

   `yarn outsmartly:deploy`

5. Enter your host url `example.outsmartly.app`. You should see your override "I have made another change. ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤¯" in the browser.
